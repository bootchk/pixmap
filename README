About
=====

This is a Python package for use by Gimp plugins.

It puts a different API on a Gimp drawable.

It buffers a Gimp drawable (you read a Gimp drawable into it, modify it, and flush it back to Gimp.)

It offers subscripting of pixels by Coord objects instead of tuples.

It returns pixels as Python arrays (1D) of pixelel values (i.e. an array of 4 ints of RGBA, or an array of one int of mask.)
